# Decision Tree

In this code, we want to use the decision tree algorithm to predict whether the passengers of the Titanic will be rescued or not.
In the implementation of this algorithm, the sklearn library is used.
First the data is pre-processed and then the decision tree algorithm is run on it.
The algorithm can be implemented with different depths of the tree and using Gini and Entropy functions.
